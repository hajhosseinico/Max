# Max App

**Max App** is a high-performance Android application built with a clean architecture approach. It leverages **Uncle Bob's Clean Code principles**, **MVI** and **MVVM** architectural patterns, and is crafted to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience. This app uses **Jetpack Compose** for UI development and **Hilt** for dependency injection, ensuring robust and scalable application architecture.

## üöÄ Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns using Uncle Bob's Clean Code principles.
- **MVVM and MVI**: The app adopts both Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Model-View-Intent (MVI) architectures to handle data flow and UI states effectively.
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Modern declarative UI with Jetpack Compose.
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**: Manage dependencies effortlessly using Hilt.
- **Room Database**: Local data persistence with Room for seamless offline support.
- **Retrofit**: Robust networking with Retrofit for API interactions.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming made easy with Kotlin Coroutines.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes **Unit Tests**, **Instrumented Tests**, and **UI Tests** using JUnit, MockK, and Jetpack Compose Testing Libraries.

## üß™ Testing Approach

This project embraces **test-driven development (TDD)** with a focus on ensuring code reliability and robustness. The testing strategy covers:

- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual units of logic, especially ViewModel and UseCase layers.
- **Instrumented Tests**: Test the app on physical or virtual devices to verify that it behaves as expected.
- **UI Tests**: Ensure UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions.

## üß© Project Architecture

The app is built using the **Clean Architecture** principles to keep code maintainable, scalable, and testable. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components built with Jetpack Compose, following **MVVM** to handle ViewModel interactions and state management.
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains UseCases to encapsulate business logic, keeping the core functionalities isolated from UI and data operations.
3. **Data Layer**: Responsible for data handling and communication with both **Room Database** and **Retrofit API services**.

## üìö Libraries and Dependencies

- **Jetpack Compose** for UI and navigation.
- **Room** for local data storage.
- **Retrofit & OkHttp** for networking.
- **Coil** for image loading.
- **Hilt** for Dependency Injection.
- **JUnit**, **MockK**, **Compose Testing Library**, and **Kotlinx Coroutines Test** for testing.
  
The dependencies in the `build.gradle` file provide full details on each library version used.
